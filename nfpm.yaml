description: |
  The txlog command is a tool for compiling and sending transaction data from
  RPM-based systems to the Txlog server. It collects information about package
  installations, updates, and removals, providing a comprehensive view of system
  changes over time. This data can be used for monitoring, analytics, and
  troubleshooting purposes. The agent operates by reading transaction logs
  generated by package managers like `yum` or `dnf`, processing the information,
  and then sending it to a specified Txlog server for storage and analysis. The
  agent is designed to be lightweight and efficient, minimizing its impact on
  system performance while ensuring accurate and timely data collection.
