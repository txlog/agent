# NAME

**txlog**: Compile data on the number of updates and installs using
yum / dnf transaction info.

# SYNOPSIS

**txlog** [*COMMAND*]

# DESCRIPTION

The **txlog** command is a tool for compiling and sending transaction data from
RPM-based systems to the Txlog server. It collects information about package
installations, updates, and removals, providing a comprehensive view of system
changes over time. This data can be used for monitoring, analytics, and
troubleshooting purposes. The agent operates by reading transaction logs
generated by package managers like `yum` or `dnf`, processing the information,
and then sending it to a specified Txlog server for storage and analysis. The
agent is designed to be lightweight and efficient, minimizing its impact on
system performance while ensuring accurate and timely data collection.

# COMMANDS

**build**
: Compile transaction info

**help**
: You know what this option does

**version**
: Show agent and server version number

## FLAGS

**--config**
: config file (default is /etc/txlog.yaml)

**--help**
: help for txlog. Use "txlog [command] --help" for more information about a command

# CONFIGURATION FILE

**/etc/txlog.yaml**
Normally `txlog` uses sane defaults, but if you want to activate any option or
integration, go to this file, uncomment the section and modify it. Useful during
development, since you can set another parameters for this environment.

# CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

All data is sent to the Transaction Log server.

## Agent section

**check_version** (boolean)
: Controls whether the agent checks for new versions when running txlog version.
When enabled, the agent will contact https://txlog.rda.run/agent/version to
verify if a new version is available. Default: true

## Server section

**url** (string)
: Specifies the URL of the txlog server where logs will be sent. Must include
protocol (http/https) and port if not using defaults. Default: http://localhost:8080

### Authentication

The agent supports two authentication methods: API key authentication and basic
authentication. You should configure only one authentication method.

**api_key** (string, optional)
: API key for authenticating with the txlog server. This is the recommended
authentication method. The API key should be in the format `txlog_...` and is
sent via the `X-API-Key` HTTP header. Must be uncommented to enable API key
authentication. Default: not set

**username** (string, optional)
: Username for basic authentication with the txlog server. This is a legacy
authentication method. Must be uncommented to enable basic authentication.
Should be used in conjunction with password. Default: not set

**password** (string, optional)
: Password for basic authentication with the txlog server. Must be uncommented
to enable basic authentication. Should be used in conjunction with username.
Default: not set

**Note:** If both API key and basic authentication credentials are configured,
the agent will use the API key and ignore the username/password. It is
recommended to configure only one authentication method to avoid confusion.

### API Key Server Compatibility

**Important:** API key authentication requires Txlog Server version 1.14.0 or
higher. When an API key is configured, the agent automatically validates the
server version on startup. If the server version is below 1.14.0, the agent will
exit with an error message indicating the incompatibility.

If you encounter a compatibility error, you have two options:

1. Upgrade the Txlog Server to version 1.14.0 or higher
2. Use basic authentication (username and password) instead of API key

Common error messages:

- **"authentication failed: invalid or revoked API key"** - The API key is not
  valid. Check that the key is correct and has not been revoked in the server.
- **"server version X does not support API key authentication"** - The server
  version is too old. Upgrade to version 1.14.0 or higher.
- **"failed to connect to server"** - Cannot reach the server. Check the URL
  and network connectivity.
